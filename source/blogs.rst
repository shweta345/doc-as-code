Compilation of technical writing and other thoughts about multiple things.

Working With Sphinx and ReadtheDocs
***********************************

Working in an enterprise software setup, such as IBM or Oracle, as a writer
you are not exposed to the nitty gritties of getting the documentation up from scratch. 
As a writer who has predominantly dabbled in technical writing on mostly organizations 
that employ the DITA methodology, the extent to playing around has mostly been limited to 
conditional tagging, ditaval filters, and most importantly the DITA files.

The startup world to me is a world full of wonder! With the line between developers and technical 
writers blurring, it is somewhat a unsaid requirement that you are adept with software terminologies
to the limits that the developer does not notice that you are basically a technical writer.

When I started off my technical writer journey, we were mostly gauged on our abilities to 
write simple sentences and interest in technology. The world has evolved and it is 
to our benefit that we sooner understand that organizations are looking at agility to adapt.

In an effort to prove my agility, I ventured into the documentation of the day - docs-as-code.
My very first project is integration of Sphinx with ReadtheDocs for build management along with 
Git as my source repository.

After integrating the site and getting it to run, I have come to the observations that -

..hlist::

* Docs-as-code will be easier for you to adapt if you let go of your DITA mindset just in the initial phase. As DITA is more focussed on modular content, I am yet to explore how modularity features in docs-as-code setup.
* Try to familiarize yourself with some programming language. This will generally help you to better understand implementing the markups. Tagging works the same way as in any XML editor, but it is presented in a bare minimum wrapper. 
* Get into the coding mindset! This will help in integrating and embracing multiple plugins and extensions that the docs-as-code offers. Don't give up but also learn the art of searching answers on the internet. 
* Embrace google search with a different perspective. You might get stuck while implementing a plugin and feel like opting out, but instead search for what you need in multiple ways. 

I am still learning the ropes of docs-as-code and as I learn, so shall I share my learnings. Just start and things 
will fall into place.
