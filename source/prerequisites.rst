Working as a Technical Writer since past 10 years, I have seen the industry evolve 
from being a very DITA-centric closed group of documentation experts to startups 
that don't want to wade through the details of DITA-OT and other integrations and 
want the results now!

I am proud to have been part of the journey from XML editing and complex DITA publishing
systems to understanding nuances of creating simple, collaborative, and faster to market 
documentation setups.
